# About This Project
This project, which I have named 'Spellbound' for the time being, is an interactive web app based on the Harry Potter universe and Rowling's Wizarding World. 

# Tech Stack
The project will use React JS for the frontend and Express JS for the backend. 

# Features
I've planned a few features for now (more to come!) , they are:
  1. Sort users into Houses
  2. Allow users to customize their profile
  3. Allow users to attend classes and take exams
  4. Magical spellbook that lists the spells and their uses
  5. Duelling mini-game
  6. User authentication and save progress
